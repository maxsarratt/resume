\begin{rSection}{EXPERIENCE}

\textbf{ic3.network} \hfill Paris, France (Remote)\\
Software Engineer \hfill \textit{Jun 2019 - Present}
 \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep -3pt {} 
\item Designed and implemented a microservice with Go and Kubernetes, which helps validate store profiles against schemas and provides API for later aggregation. Currently, it has validated more than 10K store profiles. \href{https://github.com/MurmurationsNetwork/MurmurationsServices}{[Github Repo]}
\item Examined company search API response time implemented with the full-text search mechanism in MongoDB, and combined it with Elasticsearch to rewrite the implementation in Go, ultimately increasing the speed by 53\%.
\item Architected a continuous build-test-deployment (CI/CD) system using GitHub Actions to support weekly releases and out-of-cycle releases, increasing development efficiency by 30\%.
\item  Created cron jobs to fetch user metadata and payment transactions from different services using Go, extract and combine information, and store inside PostgreSQL. Construct dashboards in Grafana to analyze users' behavior of a half-million users.
 \end{itemize}

\textbf{Rspective} \hfill Katowice, Poland (Remote)\\
Software Engineer  \hfill \textit{Nov 2018 - May 2019}
 \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep -3pt {} 
    \item Cooperated with a front-end team, defined an API using OpenAPI, and implemented with Node.js for querying advertising content based on the user city, gender, industry, etc. As a result, increased 30\% of the exposure rate for each targeting advertisement.
    \item  Teamed up with the product growth team and implemented a feature that sent recent hot topics via mobile push notification for users with low activity in Node.js, improving audience targeting and increasing active user rate by 40\%.
    \item Set up a Node.js project to detect explicit content within an image using Google Vision AI, communicated with data science and DevOps teams, and compared the accuracy and cost with an in-house image recognition system. Ultimately rescuing \$25K annual costs.
 \end{itemize}

\textbf{Maodou.io} \hfill Beijing, China\\
Software Engineer  \hfill \textit{Aug 2016 - Oct 2018}
 \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep -3pt {}
    \item Designed and initiated a large-scale web service using Node.js and MongoDB to support +100,000 MAU 6 months after launch.
    \item  Created JS scripts for API testing using Postman in order to improve team efficiency by 20\% and reduce the effort of more than 1,000 hours of manual testing.
